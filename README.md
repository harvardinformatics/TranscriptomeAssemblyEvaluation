# TranscriptomeAssemblyEvaluation
Workflows and scripts used to perform analyses for **Error, noise and bias in de novo transcriptome assemblies**, by Adam H. Freedman, M. Clamp, and T.B. Sackton posted on bioRxiv on 20 March 2019. 

## Python version and required modules
Python scripts are written to work with python 2.7. Several scripts include calls to Biopython, specifically by calling "from Bio import SeqIO", as well as numpy methods. Therefore, replication of these analyses will require Biopython, and numpy, with the latter easily obtainable via an Anaconda python distribution.
